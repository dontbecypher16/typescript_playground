# Support Template

Just a playground to remind myself of various configuration and 
support files that are needed in developing code with larger teams.

## Examples:
  * Prettier - for formatting code
  * Eslint - for syntax and errors in code
  * Jasmine - for testing 
  * TypeScript - for types to help with safer JavaScript development
